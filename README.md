I love creating, and have a passion for technology and programming. I'm an undergrad with SNHU as a Software Engineer, and have professional experience as a Front-end Web Developer.

Family is my main pillar in life; my beautiful wife and son are my everything. I take great pride in everything I do, putting in the time and effort to make my work stand out.
